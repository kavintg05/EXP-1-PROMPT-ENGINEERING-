# EXP-1-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:

###Goal: Produce a comprehensive report covering
Foundations of Generative AI,
Architectures (esp. Transformers),
Applications,
Impact of scaling in LLMs.

###Inputs
Topic outline (the 4 sections above)
Style constraints (academic tone, headings, figures/diagrams to suggest, citations if allowed)
Model(s): LLM of your choice (e.g., “writer”), optional “critic” model (can be the same model with a different system prompt)
(Optional) Knowledge sources: lecture notes, textbooks, papers, web sources

###Outputs
Final report (Markdown/Word/PDF)
(Optional) Appendix with prompts used and model metadata
## Output

## Result
